# autocad_usb_stick
I had a usb stick lying around that I store all my AutoCAD files and looked kinda dull...

So I created a case with the AutoCAD logo to make it look better!

The .dwg is the file with the design in AutoCAD 2017 ready to be printed in a 3D printer. 
The .png file, is the rendering I did to see what it looked like in a polished cherry dark red. 
The background is a room-ish I made to make it a little more realistic.
